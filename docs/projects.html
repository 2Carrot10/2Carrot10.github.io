During the 2024 season, I led the design and implementation of an auto aim algorithm. I started this project on the day of kickoff and continued refining the algorithm over our final competition. This project alone took over 150 hours of time. Below is an excerpt from the Shooter Targeting System section of the Engineering Notebook, which I wrote (thereby helping win Excellence in Engineering at a District Competition and DCMPs). </p> <br> <div style="border-left:3px solid #c0caf5"> <p class="jetbrains-mono-heavy m-2 text-tnfg"> The Shooter targeting system is an essential part of the functionality of our robot. Instead of driving up to the subwoofer [base of the goal] to shoot, the shooter targeting system allows the robot to shoot notes [game pieces] into the speaker [goal] from up to 18 feet away and an angle range of 120Â°. An intelligent targeting system allows our robot to score points faster, avoid defenders, and stay out of heavily occupied areas. <br> <br> The shooter targeting system aims the pivot of the shooter based on the position the robot detects via the visual and mechanical odometry systems. The targeting system locks into place when the robot slows down to ensure the note is not accidentally imparted with upward or downward acceleration which would cause the robot to miss shot. As soon as the robot starts moving again and the pivot angle is no longer accurate, the command dynamically readjusts to a more accurate rotation. <br> <br> The shooter targeting system has undergone massive changes throughout the build season. We have attempted 5 major shooter targeting systems: a complete numerical solution, a partial solution using a real time bisection algorithm, linear aim, polynomial curve fit, and inverse distance weighted average. We considered each of these solutions carefully, designing simulations, robot code, and mathematical models before we finally decided to use a polynomial curve fit. <br> <br> We decided to not use theoretical/mathematical approach based on the knowledge we gained from our previous shooter targeting systems: they can take up significant robot processing time, cannot possibly consider all the variation present in the robot, and are less intuitive and thereby more difficult to troubleshoot both in preparation for and during competition. For this reason, our team decided to use an empirically based solution with a precomputed curve to offload Roborio computation time to allow for more important computations. <br><br> The polynomial curve is calculated based on 44 viable position-angle combinations. Any incorrect data could negatively influence the performance of the robot in competition, so the position of the robot was measured to sub-centimeter precision and the note trajectory through the speaker was recorded with a high-speed slow-motion camera to pick up on subtle variation that the human eye could not detect. Instead of accepting angles that cause the note to just go into the speaker, we made sure the angle caused the note to go perfectly through the center of the speaker. That way, even if unexpected variation caused the note to go off course, it will most likely still pass through the goal. <br><br> In order to turn the data points into a format that the robot can quickly access in competition, we used an algorithm to minimize the total sum of squares of the residuals between the data points and polynomial model. This algorithm distilled all our data points into just 10 coefficients. The x and y positions can then be plugged in to get the ideal shooter angle in constant time. </p> </div> <br> <p class="jetbrains-mono-heavy text-tnfg">I built simulations in a variety of languages including JavaScript, Python, and Java. The final algorithm uses Python to find the polynomial curve in advance and Java to calculate the angle based on the polynomial during the match.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-col justify-around"> <img src="/mathSolution.1ae9eb68.png" alt class="border-2 border-solid border-tnfg m-1 object-contain rounded-lg"> <img src="/robotAction2.eaeb37e9.png" alt class="border-2 border-solid border-tnfg m-1 object-contain rounded-lg"> <img src="/shootgraph.4c8f6108.png" alt class="border-2 border-solid border-tnfg m-1 object-contain rounded-lg"> </div> </div>  <br>  <div id="config" class="flex flex-col-reverse justify-end m-2 md:flex-row"> <div class="flex flex-col justify-around"> <img src="/example1.3385a3c7.png" alt class="border-2 border-solid border-tnfg m-1 object-contain rounded-lg"> <img src="/example2.603725de.png" alt class="border-2 border-solid border-tnfg m-1 object-contain rounded-lg"> <img src="/example3.96fb3350.png" alt class="border-2 border-solid border-tnfg m-1 object-contain rounded-lg"> </div> <div class="flex flex-none items-center md:w-3/5"> <div class="md:border-2 md:border-solid md:border-tnfg md:m-8 md:rounded w-full"> <h1 class="jetbrains-mono-heavy m-2 text-3xl text-tnfg"> System Configuration (Arch Linux) </h1> <a class="jetbrains-mono-heavy link m-2" href="https://github.com/2Carrot10/dotfiles"><i class="nf nf-cod-github"></i> github.com/2Carrot10/dotfiles</a> <div class="m-4"> <p class="jetbrains-mono-heavy text-tnfg"> This project contains the main configuration files I use on my Arch Linux computers, an extensible configuration manager, and a config file to automatically install the operating system.

One of the most important configurations contained within this project is AwesomeWM (AWM). The AWM configuration is responsible for the layout of taskbars, panels, and widgets; the control of window tiling and titlebars; and many keybinds and motions. <br><br> The custom configuration manager allows users to install, uninstall, and track configurations using a single command. This makes it easy to store and retrieve configurations on the cloud. The configuration manager provides clear outputs and prompts, allowing the user to accept/veto every command before it is executed.

While this this 3D renderer uses the same camera controls as the Ray Tracing program, instead of calculating collision's between all rays and objects, this algorithm uses a <i>signed distance function</i> to calculate the distance between the current position of the ray and the closest object. This algorithm allows the creation of fractals and repeating geometry. This project is heavily based on the game <a class="link" href="https://github.com/HackerPoet/MarbleMarcher">Marble Marcher</a>. <br> <br> To better understand how this algorithm works, I designed a two dimensional demo. This demo makes it easy to visually ensure that the signed distance function is valid. The demo has helped solve some otherwise puzzling bugs.
