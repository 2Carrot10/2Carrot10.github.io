Semi-real-time renderer that uses global illumination and Monte Carlo ray scattering to create realistic images.
This renderer is based on concepts I learned in an online lecture series (MIT 6837).
This renderer uses a GLSL fragment shader to parallelise the rendering presses.
The image above is based on The Cornell Box. https://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/box/

I wrote this in C++, GLSL, and Bash.
