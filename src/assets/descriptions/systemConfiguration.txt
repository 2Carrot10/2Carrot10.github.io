I created a custom desktop environment. This project contains a customized window manager, text editor, shell, and more. I also made a install and download script. These scripts allow me to reach my custom workstation environment from (almost) any linux computer in just a few seconds and a single command: `yes | bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2Carrot10/dotfiles/master/download.sh)`.

This project uses the following languages:
* Lua
* Python
* Bash
